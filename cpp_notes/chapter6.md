### 6.7. Pointers to Functions XW ###

* A function pointer is a pointer that denotes a function rather than an object. 
* A function pointer points to a particular type, determined by its return type and the types of its parameters. 
* The functionâ€™s name is not part of its type. 
```cpp
// compares lengths of two strings
bool lengthCompare(const string &, const string &);
```
has type bool(const string&, const string&). To declare a pointer that can point at this function, we declare a pointer in place of the function name:
```cpp
// pf points to a function returning bool that takes two const string references
bool (*pf)(const string &, const string &);  // uninitialized
```
Starting from the name we are declaring, we see that pf is preceded by a *, so pf is a pointer. To the right is a parameter list, which means that pf points to a function. Looking left, we find that the type the function returns is bool. Thus, pf points to a function that has two const string& parameters and returns bool.

The parentheses around *pf are necessary. If we omit the parentheses, then we declare pf as a function that returns a pointer to bool:
```cpp
// declares a function named pf that returns a bool*
bool *pf(const string &, const string &);
```



###Using Function Pointers###
* When we use the name of a function as a value, the function is automatically converted to a pointer. 
```cpp
pf = lengthCompare;  // pf now points to the function named lengthCompare
pf = &lengthCompare; // equivalent assignment: address-of operator is optional
```
* we can use a pointer to a function to call the function to which the pointer points. 
* there is no need to dereference the pointer:
```cpp
bool b1 = pf("hello", "goodbye");    // calls lengthCompare
bool b2 = (*pf)("hello", "goodbye"); // equivalent call
bool b3 = lengthCompare("hello", "goodbye"); // equivalent call
```
* There is no conversion between pointers to one function type and pointers to another function type. 
* we can assign nullptr or a zero-valued integer constant expression to a function pointer to indicate that the pointer does not point to any function:
```cpp
string::size_type sumLength(const string&, const string&);
bool cstringCompare(const char*, const char*);
pf = 0;              // ok: pf points to no function
pf = sumLength;      // error: return type differs
pf = cstringCompare; // error: parameter types differ
pf = lengthCompare;  // ok: function and pointer types match exactly
```

###Pointers to Overloaded Functions###
* When we declare a pointer to an overloaded function, the compiler uses the type of the pointer to determine which overloaded function to use. 
```cpp
void ff(int*);
void ff(unsigned int);
void (*pf1)(unsigned int) = ff;  // pf1 points to ff(unsigned)
```
* The type of the pointer must match one of the overloaded functions exactly:
```cpp
void (*pf2)(int) = ff;    // error: no ff with a matching parameter list
double (*pf3)(int*) = ff; // error: return type of ff and pf3 don't match
```


###Function Pointer Parameters###
* we can have a parameter that is a pointer to function. 
* we can write a parameter that looks like a function type, but it will be treated as a pointer
```cpp
// third parameter is a function type and is automatically treated as a pointer to function
void useBigger(const string &s1, const string &s2,
               bool pf(const string &, const string &));
// equivalent declaration: explicitly define the parameter as a pointer to function
void useBigger(const string &s1, const string &s2,
               bool (*pf)(const string &, const string &));
```
* When we pass a function as an argument, we can do so directly. It will be automatically converted to a pointer:
```cpp
// automatically converts the function lengthCompare to a pointer to function
useBigger(s1, s2, lengthCompare);
```
* Type aliases and decltype can simplify code that uses function pointers:
```cpp
// Func and Func2 have function type
typedef bool Func(const string&, const string&);
typedef decltype(lengthCompare) Func2; // equivalent type

// FuncP and FuncP2 have pointer to function type
typedef bool(*FuncP)(const string&, const string&);
typedef decltype(lengthCompare) *FuncP2;  // equivalent type
```

Here weâ€™ve used typedef to define our types. Both Func and Func2 are function types, whereas FuncP and FuncP2 are pointer types. 
* decltype returns the function type; 
* the automatic conversion to pointer is not done. 
* if we want a pointer we must add the * ourselves. 
```cpp
// equivalent declarations of useBigger using type aliases
void useBigger(const string&, const string&, Func);
void useBigger(const string&, const string&, FuncP2);
```
* Both declarations declare the same function.
* In the first case, the compiler will automatically convert the function type represented by Func to a pointer.


###Returning a Pointer to Function###
* we canâ€™t return a function type but can return a pointer to a function type. 
* we must write the return type as a pointer type; 
* the compiler will not automatically treat a function return type as the corresponding pointer type. 
* the easiest way to declare a function that returns a pointer to function is by using a type alias:
```cpp
using F = int(int*, int);     // F is a function type, not a pointer
using PF = int(*)(int*, int); // PF is a pointer type
```
Here we used type alias declarations to define F as a function type and PF as a pointer to function type. 
* the return type is not automatically converted to a pointer type. 
* We must explicitly specify that the return type is a pointer type:
```cpp
PF f1(int); // ok: PF is a pointer to function; f1 returns a pointer to function
F f1(int);  // error: F is a function type; f1 can't return a function
F *f1(int); // ok: explicitly specify that the return type is a pointer to function
```

Of course, we can also declare f1 directly, which weâ€™d do as
```cpp
int (*f1(int))(int*, int);
```

* Reading this declaration from the inside out
* f1 has a parameter list, so f1 is a function. 
* f1 is preceded by a * so f1 returns a pointer. 
* The type of that pointer itself has a parameter list, so the pointer points to a function. 
* That function returns an int.


* we can simplify declarations of functions that return pointers to function by using a ```trailing return```:
```cpp
auto f1(int) -> int (*)(int*, int);
```
