# Chapter 2 Rules

* Dependencies graph
* *Explicit rules*.
* *Pattern rules* uses wildcards instead of explicit filenames.


## Explicite Rules

A rule can have more than one target. 

```makefile
vpath.o variable.o: make.h config.h getopt.h gettext.h dep.h
```


## Phony Targets

```makefile
.PHONY: clean
clean:
        rm -f *.o lexer.c      
```

**Standard phony targets**
all, install, clean, distclean, TAGS, info, check

## Variables

```
$(variable_name)
```

The variable will expand

```makefile
 # Define the symbols we might want to change:
CXX	:= c++
CXXFLAGS := -g
    
OBJECTS	:= processing.o gui.o
    
my_program: $(OBJECTS)
	$(CXX) $(OBJECTS) -o my_program
    
processing.o: processing.cxx
	$(CXX) $(INCLUDES) $(CXXFLAGS) -c processing.cxx -o processing.o
    
gui.o: gui.cxx
    	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c gui.cxx -o gui.o
```




## Automatic variables
\$@
The filename representing the target.

\$%
The filename element of an archive member specification.

\$<
The filename of the first prerequisite.

\$?
The names of all prerequisites that are newer than the target, separated by spaces.

\$^
The filenames of all the prerequisites, separated by spaces. This list has duplicate filenames removed since for most uses, such as compiling, copying, etc., duplicates are not wanted.

\$+
Similar to \$^, this is the names of all the prerequisites separated by spaces, except that \$+ includes duplicates. This variable was created for specific situations such as arguments to linkers where duplicate values have meaning.

\$*
The stem of the target filename. A stem is typically a filename without its suffix. (Weâ€™ll discuss how stems are computed later in the section Pattern Rules.) Its use outside of pattern rules is discouraged.
